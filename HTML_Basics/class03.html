Super focused on HTML as it is content, and careful with adding too much javascript or CSS 
It is better to keep it content focused as many users also don't have high broadband
If there is so much high level coding it could increase the bounce rate of end users 

CSS 
How do you link HTML file to CSS?
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css">
This link tag will go in the head of our html file; this link tag is saying you will
leave from this html file and find the css in the href <section></section>
Href in the css link tab goes by folder name/file name
CSS Syntax (its own language)

p {
    color: red;
}
This whole line of code is a rule. Selector is the P. Color is the Property.
Red is the property value. Color and red are the Declaration / declaration block.

We can select all our paragraphs and change their color. Or change all the headers
by selecting those.

p{
    color: red;
    font-weight: bold;
}
A rule is broken down into 2 things: A selector and a declaration block. 
Inside the curly braces is a declaration block. Which is broken up into declaration.
"color: red;" is a declaration and also is "font-weight: bold;" which is broken up 
into a property and property value.

The whole point of CSS is to select something and then change what it looks like.
P selector is selecting all paragraphs

CSS stands for cascading style sheets. It is read from top to bottom. The declarations and rules further down
below can override the stuff from above.

p{
    color: red;
    font-weight: bold;
}
p{
    color: blue;
}
^this means the paragraphs will actually be blue, but they will remain bold.

LETS LEARN SOME STYLES
Color:

Word
h1{
    color: red;
}
Hexadecimal
h2{
    color: #FF00000;
}
RGBa
p{
    color: rgba(255,0,0,1);
}
HSLa
span{
    color: hsla(0, 100%, 50%,1);
}
you can use eyedropper browser extension to pick a color and it will give you all the codes for it.

Font-Family 
you need the actual font, then you need to tell css to use that font.

CSS 
p{
    font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', 'Helvetica' sans-serif;
}

You can use google fonts to find fonts, choose the one you like and choose the weights. Then you can go to the 
dashboard icon and copy the larger code for html which you will put it before your style sheet link. 
And the css will go with your declaration block.

Font-weight 
you can go ahead and select a font weight from the fonts you selected if you wish to do so, you just add the
declaration.
p{
    font-family: 'Source Sans Pro', 'Helvetica' sans-serif;
    font-weight: 700;
}

how to use MDN? all you do is say the thing you wanna do, the language and then MDN
so italic css mdn for example

You can also select by relationship, parent > child
If you use a > (right carat) then it must be a DIRECT child to the parent.
If you just use a space after parent child or section p {} then even if its
a grandchild or more it will still work.
Sibling Relationships
previous sibling + next sibling
p + p {
    color: red;
}
IDs are used for selecting distinct elements
Only one id with the same value per document
#idName 
easier to select that unique element bc of the unique id associated with it

Classes enable you to select multiple elements at the same time
Multiple with same value allowed per document
.classname 
You can assign those multiple elements to one class then select that one class 
to change those all how you like.

Specificity overrides being lower in the cascade.
section > p {
    Color: red;
}
p{
    color: blue;
}
The first section > p overrides the second rule bc it is more specific
