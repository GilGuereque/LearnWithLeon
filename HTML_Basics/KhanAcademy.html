            <h2>Why Khan Academy Works</h2>
            <h4>Personalized Learning</h4>
            <p>Students practice at their own pace, first filling in gaps in their understanding and then accelerating their learning.</p>
            <h4>Trust Content</h4>
            <p>Created by experts, Khan Academy’s library of trusted, standards-aligned practice and lessons covers math K-12 through early college, grammar, science, history, AP®, SAT®, and more. It’s all free for learners and teachers.</p>
            <h4>Tool to empower teachers</h4>
            <p>With Khan Academy, teachers can identify gaps in their students’ understanding, tailor instruction, and meet the needs of every student.</p>
